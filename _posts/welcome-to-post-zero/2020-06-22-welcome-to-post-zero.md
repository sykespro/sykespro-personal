## Welcome to "Post Zero"

Welcome to my personal blog that I intend to use as my journal of my experience as a technical leader building web and mobile solutions. 

### My Motto 
Thinking Creatively | Planning Strategically | Executing Passionately

###  Why did I choose Jekyll?
This choice was relatively easy - it's static! I didn't want to bother with any databases and/or any server-side technologies. The goal is to be able to record information, not manage another application.

### What should visitors expect?
Visitors can expect to stumble on a wide range of topics as you would if you read anyone's journal.  I've had the pleasure to learn, lead, and execute on many creative and technical projects over the last 15 years. There were many lessons learned and tactics discovered. I intend to write about these experiences, along with technology, leadership, and personal growth.
 
Stay tuned.
